# Planning Theory (Bratman)

Michael Bratman's Planning Theory extends [[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]] by treating intentions as commitments that play crucial roles in coordinating action across time, rather than mere desires or wishes.

## Key Innovation: Intentions as Plans

**Stated Intentions**: Articulated plans or commitments that agents make public for coordination with others and self-commitment.

**Actual Intentions**: Underlying planning structures that may involve:
- Partial plans with gaps to be filled in
- Hierarchical goal structures
- Conditional intentions dependent on circumstances

**Observed Actions**: Behaviors that result from executing plans, which may reveal planning structures not evident in stated intentions.

## Temporal Coordination

Unlike [[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]], Bratman emphasizes how intentions coordinate action over extended periods:
- **Stability**: Plans resist reconsideration to enable sustained action
- **Coherence**: Intentions must fit together in rationally consistent ways
- **Means-end coherence**: Plans generate sub-plans and specific actions

## Observer Interpretation

Observers can interpret planning structures by:
- Recognizing patterns of consistent behavior over time
- Inferring hierarchical goal structures from action sequences
- Noting when agents stick to plans despite changing circumstances

This connects to [[Intentional Stance]] strategies and [[Theory of Mind]] processes.

## Four-Part Framework Application

Bratman's theory directly addresses gaps between:
1. **Stated vs. Actual Plans**: Public commitments may differ from private planning structures
2. **Plans vs. Execution**: Actual behavior may reveal unspoken planning assumptions
3. **Observer Inference**: Others must reconstruct planning structures from behavioral evidence

## Connections to Other Frameworks

**Complements**: 
- [[Pragmatic Approaches]] through focus on practical problem-solving
- [[Reasoned Action Approach]] by providing psychological mechanisms for behavioral prediction

**Tensions with**:
- [[Embodied Phenomenology]] which emphasizes pre-reflective, non-planned action
- [[Chinese Philosophy]] concepts like wu wei that transcend deliberate planning

## Applications

Planning Theory proves especially valuable for:
- **Legal contexts**: Understanding criminal intent and premeditation
- **AI and robotics**: Designing systems that can plan and coordinate
- **Organizational behavior**: Understanding how teams coordinate through shared plans
- **Personal development**: How individuals can better align their stated goals with actual planning and execution

## Limitations

- May over-intellectualize spontaneous or habitual action
- Cultural bias toward Western planning-oriented approaches
- Difficulty handling [[Embodied Phenomenology]] insights about motor intentionality
- Limited attention to [[Ethics of Care]] relational dimensions of planning
