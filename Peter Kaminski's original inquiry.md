# Peter Kaminski's original inquiry

This wiki started as a question/answer with ChatGPT 4o. I took that answer over to Claude Sonnet 4 and expanded on it to create this wiki. See that story at [[Meta-Reflection - Creating the Intention-Action Wiki]].

## Peter Kaminski

tell me about philosophical frameworks that include 1) stated intentions, 2) actual intentions, which may be different, and 3) observed actions, which may be different. bonus points for a framework that also considers observers of the three kinds of intentions / actions.

## ChatGPT 4o

Your inquiry touches on a rich intersection of philosophy, psychology, and ethics. Several philosophical frameworks address the distinctions between stated intentions, actual intentions, and observed actions, as well as the perspectives of observers interpreting these elements. Here's an overview of key frameworks that explore these concepts:

---

### 1. **Elizabeth Anscombe’s Theory of Intention**

In her seminal work _Intention_, Anscombe distinguishes between:([nordicwittgensteinreview.com](https://www.nordicwittgensteinreview.com/article/download/3683/54/9761?utm_source=chatgpt.com "[PDF] Wittgenstein and Anscombe's Intention"))

- **Stated Intentions**: What individuals claim they intend to do.
- **Actual Intentions**: The genuine motivations behind actions, which may differ from stated intentions.
- **Observed Actions**: The external behaviors that may or may not align with the individual's intentions.

Anscombe emphasizes that intentional actions are those to which the question "Why?" applies, highlighting the importance of understanding the agent's perspective. She also notes the asymmetry between first-person knowledge (self-awareness of one's intentions) and third-person observation (external interpretation of actions).

### 2. **Michael Bratman’s Planning Theory of Intention**

Bratman introduces a model where intentions are not merely desires but commitments that play a crucial role in planning and guiding actions over time. This framework accounts for:([plato.stanford.edu](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intention/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Intention - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"))

- **Stated Intentions**: Articulated plans or goals.
- **Actual Intentions**: Underlying commitments that drive behavior.
- **Observed Actions**: Behaviors that result from executing plans.

Bratman's theory also considers how observers interpret actions based on perceived intentions, acknowledging that discrepancies can arise between observed behavior and inferred intentions.

### 3. **Daniel Dennett’s Intentional Stance**

Dennett proposes the "intentional stance" as a strategy for interpreting behavior by attributing beliefs, desires, and intentions to agents. This approach involves:([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Intentional stance - Wikipedia"))

- **Assuming Rationality**: Treating the agent as rational to predict behavior.
- **Attributing Mental States**: Inferring beliefs and desires that would make the observed behavior rational.
- **Predicting Actions**: Using these attributions to anticipate future behavior.([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Intentional stance - Wikipedia"))

This framework highlights the role of observers in interpreting actions and intentions, acknowledging that such interpretations are influenced by the observer's own perspective and assumptions.

### 4. **Theory of Mind and Observer Perspectives**

Research in cognitive science explores how individuals understand others' mental states—a concept known as "theory of mind." This involves:

- **Inferring Intentions**: Observers use cues from behavior to infer the intentions behind actions.
- **Understanding Discrepancies**: Recognizing that observed actions may not always align with stated or actual intentions.
- **Social Implications**: These inferences affect social interactions, judgments, and moral evaluations.([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27393254/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Understanding intentional actions from observers' viewpoints"))

Studies suggest that the brain employs distinct systems for processing observed actions and inferring intentions, underscoring the complexity of interpreting others' behaviors. ([pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27393254/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Understanding intentional actions from observers' viewpoints"))

### 5. **Ideal Observer Theory in Ethics**

This meta-ethical theory posits that moral judgments can be understood by considering the reactions of a hypothetical "ideal observer"—a being who is fully informed, impartial, and rational. In this context:([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_observer_theory?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ideal observer theory"))

- **Stated and Actual Intentions**: The ideal observer assesses the congruence between what agents claim and what they truly intend.
- **Observed Actions**: Evaluated in light of the agent's intentions and the outcomes.
- **Moral Judgments**: Derived from the perspective of the ideal observer, who considers all relevant factors without bias.

This framework emphasizes the role of an informed and impartial perspective in evaluating the moral dimensions of actions and intentions.

---

### 6. **Reasoned Action Approach (RAA)**

In social psychology, the RAA explains behavior as a function of:([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoned_action_approach?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Reasoned action approach"))

- **Attitudes**: Personal evaluations of the behavior.
- **Subjective Norms**: Perceived social pressures.
- **Perceived Behavioral Control**: Belief in one's ability to perform the behavior.([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasoned_action_approach?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Reasoned action approach"))

These factors shape behavioral intentions, which in turn predict actual behavior. The model acknowledges that observers may interpret actions differently based on their own beliefs and norms, highlighting the importance of context in understanding behavior.

### 7. **Ethics of Care**

This ethical framework emphasizes the importance of interpersonal relationships and the context of moral decision-making. It focuses on:([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Epistemology - Wikipedia"))

- **Relational Dynamics**: Understanding intentions and actions within the web of relationships.
- **Contextual Evaluation**: Assessing behavior by considering the specific circumstances and needs of those involved.
- **Empathy and Responsiveness**: Valuing the emotional and relational aspects of moral judgments.

The ethics of care approach underscores the significance of observers' perspectives, particularly in interpreting the intentions and actions of others within relational contexts. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_care?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ethics of care"))

These frameworks collectively offer nuanced perspectives on the interplay between stated intentions, actual intentions, observed actions, and the role of observers. They highlight the complexity of human behavior and the importance of context, perception, and interpretation in understanding actions and intentions.
