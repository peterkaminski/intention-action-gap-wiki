# Wiki Index - Philosophical Frameworks on Intention and Action

This wiki explores how different philosophical traditions understand the relationships between stated intentions, actual intentions, observed actions, and observer perspectives. Each framework offers unique insights into these fundamental aspects of human agency and interpretation.

## Overview and Navigation

### **Getting Started**
- [[Framework Navigation Guide]] - Practical guide for selecting and combining frameworks based on context and goals
- [[Philosophical Frameworks - Intention, Action, and Interpretation]] - Comprehensive comparison table of all frameworks
- [[Synthesis Overview]] - How different frameworks can be integrated for comprehensive understanding
- [[Meta-Reflection - Creating the Intention-Action Wiki]] - Methodological insights from the wiki creation process

## Core Philosophical Frameworks

### **Foundational Western Approaches**
- [[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]] - Foundational analysis of intentional action and first-person authority
- [[Planning Theory]] - Michael Bratman's theory of intentions as commitments coordinating action over time
- [[Husserlian Phenomenology]] - Edmund Husserl's analysis of consciousness and intentional directedness

### **Empirical and Cognitive Approaches**
- [[Theory of Mind]] - Cognitive science research on how observers attribute mental states to others

- [[Hermeneutic Phenomenology]] - Martin Heidegger's historically and culturally situated interpretation

### **Embodied and Practical Approaches**
- [[Embodied Phenomenology]] - Maurice Merleau-Ponty's theory of motor intentionality and bodily intelligence
- [[Pragmatic Approaches]] - Classical American pragmatism (Peirce, James, Dewey) treating ideas as tools for action

### **Relational and Ethical Approaches**
- [[Ethics of Care]] - Relational framework emphasizing care relationships and contextual moral reasoning
- [[Ideal Observer Theory]] - Meta-ethical theory using hypothetical impartial observers for moral evaluation

### **Alternative and Contemporary Approaches**
- [[Chinese Philosophy]] - Daoist and Confucian alternatives to Western individual agency assumptions

## Key Concepts Across Frameworks

### **Types of Intention**
- **Stated Intentions**: Explicitly expressed goals and plans
- **Actual Intentions**: Genuine underlying motivations and commitments
- **Motor Intentions**: Embodied directedness toward action ([[Embodied Phenomenology]])
- **Planning Intentions**: Extended commitments coordinating future action ([[Planning Theory]])
- **Corporate Intentions**: Collective agency and institutional directedness ([[Corporate Intention and Action]])

### **Action Categories**
- **Intentional Action**: Action performed with conscious intention ([[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]])
- **Skilled Action**: Expert performance with embodied intelligence ([[Embodied Phenomenology]])
- **Wu Wei**: Effortless action in harmony with natural flow ([[Chinese Philosophy]])
- **Planned Action**: Behavior resulting from extended planning processes ([[Planning Theory]])
- **Corporate Action**: Collective behavior of institutional entities ([[Corporate Intention and Action]])

### **Observer Approaches**
- **First-Person Authority**: Direct access to one's own intentions ([[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]], [[Husserlian Phenomenology]])
- **Empathetic Understanding**: Understanding others through care and emotional engagement ([[Ethics of Care]])
- **Strategic Attribution**: Pragmatic mental state attribution for prediction ([[Intentional Stance]])
- **Embodied Simulation**: Understanding others through bodily resonance ([[Embodied Phenomenology]])
- **Hermeneutic Interpretation**: Cultural-historically situated understanding ([[Hermeneutic Phenomenology]])
- **Ideal Observation**: Hypothetical impartial, fully-informed perspective ([[Ideal Observer Theory]])

## Application Domains
