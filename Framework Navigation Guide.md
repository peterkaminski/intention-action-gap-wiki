# Framework Navigation Guide

This guide helps navigate between different philosophical frameworks based on your specific inquiry needs, context, and goals. Use this as a practical tool for selecting and combining approaches to intention, action, and interpretation.

## The Four-Part Framework: Our Organizing Principle

This wiki organizes philosophical frameworks around a **four-part analytical structure** that captures the core relationships between intention, action, and interpretation:

### **1. Stated Intentions**
What people explicitly claim they intend to do - their publicly expressed goals, plans, or motivations. These may be:
- Honest expressions of genuine intentions
- Strategic communications for social purposes
- Self-deceptive rationalizations
- Incomplete articulations of complex motivations

### **2. Actual Intentions**
The genuine motivations, commitments, or directedness behind actions, which may differ from stated intentions due to:
- Unconscious motivations
- Social pressure to misrepresent
- Self-deception or incomplete self-knowledge
- Multiple conflicting intentions

### **3. Observed Actions**
The external behaviors that can be witnessed, which may align or misalign with both stated and actual intentions due to:
- Unexpected circumstances or obstacles
- Unconscious habits overriding conscious intentions
- Skill limitations or execution failures
- Environmental factors beyond the agent's control

### **4. Observer Perspectives**
How external interpreters make sense of the relationships between the first three elements, involving:
- Attribution of mental states to others
- Cultural and personal biases in interpretation
- Different strategies for handling intention-action gaps
- Varying standards for moral and practical evaluation

## Why This Framework Matters

**Cross-Framework Analysis**: Each philosophical tradition handles these four elements differently, revealing their unique insights and limitations.

**Practical Relevance**: Real-world situations (legal, therapeutic, educational, interpersonal) require navigating gaps between stated intentions, actual intentions, and observed actions.

**Cultural Sensitivity**: Different cultures have varying approaches to intention attribution, honesty about motivations, and observer responsibilities.

**Synthesis Potential**: The four-part structure provides a common language for comparing and integrating otherwise disparate philosophical approaches.

## How the Framework Appears in Each Article

Every framework article includes a **"Four-Part Framework Analysis"** section showing how that particular tradition understands:
- What stated intentions represent and how they function
- How actual intentions are conceptualized (or whether the concept is rejected)
- How observed actions are interpreted and evaluated  
- What role observers play and what methods they should use

This allows for **direct comparison** across frameworks and reveals **synthesis opportunities** where different traditions might complement each other.

## Framework Comparison Overview

For a comprehensive overview of all frameworks and their key distinctions, see the [[Philosophical Frameworks - Intention, Action, and Interpretation]] comparison table.

## Framework Compatibility Matrix

### **Highly Compatible Combinations**
- [[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]] + [[Husserlian Phenomenology]]: Shared first-person focus

### **Productive Tensions**
- [[Husserlian Phenomenology]] + [[Embodied Phenomenology]]: Consciousness vs. embodiment priority
- [[Intentional Stance]] + [[Ethics of Care]]: Strategic vs. empathetic interpretation
- [[Planning Theory]] + [[Chinese Philosophy]]: Rational planning vs. wu wei spontaneity
- [[Ideal Observer Theory]] + [[Hermeneutic Phenomenology]]: Universal vs. contextual standards

### **Challenging Combinations**
- [[Chinese Philosophy]] + [[Reasoned Action Approach]]: Collective vs. individual agency
- [[Embodied Phenomenology]] + [[Planning Theory]]: Pre-reflective vs. deliberate action

## Progressive Integration Strategies

### **Starting Simple: Two-Framework Combinations**
1. **Choose primary framework** based on your main concern
2. **Add complementary framework** to address limitations
3. **Identify key tensions** and how to navigate them
4. **Test integration** in specific cases

### **Intermediate: Three-Framework Synthesis**
1. **Individual level**: Choose one framework for understanding individual psychology
2. **Interpersonal level**: Add framework for social/relational dynamics  
3. **Cultural level**: Include framework for broader context
4. **Map interactions** between levels

### **Advanced: Multi-Framework Integration**
1. **Identify core question** requiring multiple perspectives
2. **Map relevant frameworks** and their contributions
3. **Develop integration strategy** using [[Synthesis Overview]]
4. **Test and refine** through application

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### **Framework Imperialism**
**Problem**: Trying to apply one framework to all situations
**Solution**: Use [[Pragmatic Approaches]] criteria for contextual appropriateness

### **Incommensurable Conflicts**
**Problem**: Frameworks seem to contradict each other completely
**Solution**: Look for different levels of analysis or domains of application

### **Superficial Eclecticism**
**Problem**: Combining frameworks without understanding their deep commitments
**Solution**: Study each framework thoroughly before attempting integration

### **Cultural Blindness**
**Problem**: Assuming Western frameworks apply universally
**Solution**: Always include [[Chinese Philosophy]] or other non-Western perspectives

## Practical Application Checklist

### **Before Choosing Frameworks**
- [ ] Clarify your specific question or problem
- [ ] Identify relevant temporal, cultural, and relational contexts
- [ ] Consider your practical goals (understanding, prediction, intervention)
- [ ] Acknowledge your own cultural and theoretical biases

### **When Combining Frameworks**
- [ ] Understand each framework's core commitments
- [ ] Identify points of compatibility and tension
- [ ] Develop strategy for navigating contradictions
- [ ] Test integration with specific examples

### **During Application**
- [ ] Remain sensitive to context and cultural factors
- [ ] Be prepared to revise framework choices
- [ ] Pay attention to what each framework illuminates and obscures
- [ ] Consider feedback from stakeholders and participants

### **For Ongoing Development**
- [ ] Regularly reassess framework effectiveness
- [ ] Stay open to new frameworks and developments
- [ ] Engage with practitioners from different traditions
- [ ] Contribute to framework integration research

## Advanced Navigation Strategies

### **Dialectical Integration**
Use tensions between frameworks productively rather than resolving them prematurely. [[Husserlian Phenomenology]] and [[Embodied Phenomenology]] tension can generate deeper insights.

### **Contextual Switching**
Move fluidly between frameworks based on situational demands. Use [[Intentional Stance]] for strategic interactions, [[Ethics of Care]] for intimate relationships.

### **Meta-Level Perspective**
Use [[Pragmatic Approaches]] or [[Hermeneutic Phenomenology]] to evaluate when other frameworks are most appropriate.

### **Experimental Application**
Follow [[Pragmatic Approaches]] by testing framework combinations and revising based on practical success.

This guide should be used as a living document, updated based on your experience with different framework combinations and their effectiveness in various contexts.
