# Reasoned Action Approach

The Reasoned Action Approach (RAA) from social psychology provides a systematic framework for understanding how attitudes, social norms, and perceived control shape the relationship between stated intentions, actual intentions, and observed actions.

## Core Components

**Attitudes**: Personal evaluations of performing the behavior (positive/negative)

**Subjective Norms**: Perceived social pressure to perform or not perform the behavior

**Perceived Behavioral Control**: Beliefs about one's ability to actually perform the behavior

These three factors combine to predict **behavioral intentions**, which in turn predict **actual behavior**.

## Four-Part Framework Application

**Stated Intentions**: Often reflect socially desirable responses influenced by:
- Perceived social norms about what intentions are acceptable to express
- Strategic presentation of self to different audiences
- Genuine uncertainty about one's own attitudes and capabilities

**Actual Intentions**: Emerge from private integration of:
- True personal attitudes (which may differ from publicly expressed ones)
- Realistic assessment of social pressures
- Honest evaluation of behavioral control

**Observed Actions**: May deviate from intentions due to:
- Unexpected barriers or facilitators
- Changed circumstances since intention formation
- Overestimation of behavioral control

**Observer Perspective**: Others interpret behavior by inferring the underlying attitude-norm-control structure, often incorrectly assuming their own framework applies to the observed person.

## Connection to Other Frameworks

**Builds on**:
- [[Planning Theory]] by specifying psychological mechanisms behind planning
- [[Theory of Mind]] research on how people attribute mental states
- [[Intentional Stance]] assumptions about rational choice

**Complements**:
- [[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]] by explaining why stated and actual intentions diverge
- [[Pragmatic Approaches]] through focus on practical behavior prediction

**Limited by**:
- [[Embodied Phenomenology]] insights about non-reflective, habitual action
- [[Ethics of Care]] emphasis on relational context beyond individual attitudes
- [[Chinese Philosophy]] alternative conceptions of agency and choice

## Strengths for Synthesis

The RAA provides valuable synthesis tools by:
- **Quantifying factors**: Offering measurable variables for comparing frameworks
- **Predicting gaps**: Explaining systematic differences between intention and action
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Recognizing that norms and controls vary across contexts
- **Observer bias**: Acknowledging that interpreters project their own attitude-norm-control structures

## Empirical Validation

Extensive research demonstrates:
- Strong prediction of intention from attitudes, norms, and control
- Moderate prediction of behavior from intentions
- Cultural variations in the relative importance of each component
- Systematic biases in how observers attribute attitudes and norms to others

## Applications

The RAA proves useful for:
- **Health behavior change**: Understanding barriers to implementing health intentions
- **Educational interventions**: Designing programs that address attitudes, norms, and control
- **Organizational change**: Predicting employee response to new policies
- **Legal contexts**: Understanding factors that influence compliance with laws

## Limitations and Critiques

**Rationality Assumption**: Like [[Intentional Stance]], assumes people consciously weigh factors, missing [[Embodied Phenomenology]] insights about non-reflective action

**Individual Focus**: Underemphasizes [[Ethics of Care]] relational dimensions and [[Hermeneutic Phenomenology]] cultural-linguistic context

**Static Model**: Doesn't capture [[Deweyan Instrumentalism]] emphasis on learning and adaptation through action

**Western Bias**: May not apply to [[Chinese Philosophy]] concepts of collective agency and wu wei

## Synthesis Contributions

The RAA helps synthesize other frameworks by:
- Providing operational definitions for concepts like "social context" and "personal agency"
- Explaining when different frameworks might be most predictive (high vs. low perceived control, individual vs. collective norms)
- Offering bridges between individual psychological frameworks ([[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]], [[Planning Theory]]) and social frameworks ([[Ethics of Care]], cultural approaches)

## Integration with Phenomenological Insights

Recent RAA research increasingly incorporates:
- [[Embodied Phenomenology]] through attention to bodily experiences and automatic processes
- [[Hermeneutic Phenomenology]] through cultural adaptation of norms and attitudes
- [[Ethics of Care]] through expanded conception of social norms to include care relationships

## Future Directions

Emerging RAA research explores:
- Integration with [[Theory of Mind]] findings about attribution biases
- Applications to [[Ideal Observer Theory]] questions about optimal decision-making
- Connections to [[Pragmatic Approaches]] in educational and policy contexts
- Cross-cultural validation with [[Chinese Philosophy]] and other non-Western traditions
