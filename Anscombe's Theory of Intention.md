# Anscombe's Theory of Intention

Elizabeth Anscombe's seminal work *Intention* provides the foundational framework for understanding the relationship between stated intentions, actual intentions, and observed actions from both first-person and third-person perspectives.

## Core Distinctions

**Stated Intentions**: What individuals explicitly claim they intend to do. These are publicly articulated goals or plans that may or may not reflect deeper motivations.

**Actual Intentions**: The genuine motivations behind actions, which may differ significantly from stated intentions due to self-deception, strategic misrepresentation, or incomplete self-knowledge.

**Observed Actions**: External behaviors that may align or misalign with both stated and actual intentions, creating interpretive challenges for observers.

## The "Why?" Question

Anscombe's central insight is that intentional actions are those to which the question "Why?" applies meaningfully. This distinguishes intentional actions from mere happenings or reflexive behaviors.

## First-Person vs. Third-Person Asymmetry

A crucial element of Anscombe's framework is the epistemological asymmetry between:
- **First-person knowledge**: Direct, non-observational access to one's own intentions
- **Third-person interpretation**: External observers must infer intentions from available evidence

This asymmetry creates fundamental challenges for [[Theory of Mind]] processes and [[Intentional Stance]] attributions.

## Connections to Other Frameworks

Anscombe's work directly influences:
- [[Planning Theory]] through its emphasis on intention as distinct from mere desire
- [[Husserlian Phenomenology]] by highlighting the first-person perspective
- [[Non-Causalist Theories]] through her resistance to simple causal models
- [[Ethics of Care]] in recognizing the interpretive challenges in relationships

## Contemporary Relevance

Anscombe's framework remains foundational for understanding:
- Legal responsibility and criminal intent
- Therapeutic contexts where stated and actual motivations diverge
- Moral evaluation of actions with mixed or unclear motivations
- [[Pragmatic Approaches]] to truth and meaning in interpersonal contexts

## Limitations and Critiques

While comprehensive, Anscombe's framework has been critiqued for:
- Insufficient attention to social and cultural context (addressed by [[Hermeneutic Phenomenology]])
- Limited consideration of embodied and pre-reflective action (developed by [[Embodied Phenomenology]])
- Potential over-intellectualization of everyday action (challenged by [[Pragmatic Approaches]])
