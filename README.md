# The Intention-Action Gap Wiki

## Philosophical Frameworks for Understanding Human Agency

This wiki explores the complex relationships between what people say they intend to do, what they actually intend, what they end up doing, and how others interpret their behavior. It synthesizes insights from thirteen major philosophical traditions—ranging from classical phenomenology to contemporary cognitive science, from ancient Chinese philosophy to modern corporate ethics—into an interconnected knowledge system that reveals both the unique contributions and synthesis potential of different approaches to human agency.

**Curation and Creation**: This wiki was curated by Peter Kaminski and created by Claude Sonnet 4 through collaborative dialogue. The content represents a systematic analysis and synthesis of philosophical frameworks, but **none of the pages have been reviewed or fact-checked by human experts yet**. Readers should verify claims and consult original sources for authoritative information.

## Getting Started

The wiki is designed with multiple entry points depending on your interests and needs:

- **[[Wiki Index]]** - Comprehensive table of contents with all frameworks organized by type, focus area, and application domain
- **[[Framework Navigation Guide]]** - Practical guide for selecting and combining frameworks based on your specific context and goals  
- **[[Philosophical Frameworks - Intention, Action, and Interpretation]]** - Side-by-side comparison table showing how each framework handles the four core elements
- **[[Synthesis Overview]]** - How different frameworks can be integrated for more comprehensive understanding
- **[[Meta-Reflection: Creating the Intention-Action Wiki]]** - Methodological insights from the wiki creation process and broader implications for philosophical synthesis

## Four-Part Analytical Framework

This wiki organizes all philosophical approaches around four key elements that capture the core relationships in human agency:

1. **Stated Intentions** - What people explicitly claim they intend to do
2. **Actual Intentions** - The genuine motivations that may differ from stated intentions  
3. **Observed Actions** - External behaviors that may align or conflict with intentions
4. **Observer Perspectives** - How others interpret and make sense of intention-action relationships

Each framework article analyzes how that philosophical tradition understands these four elements, enabling direct comparison and synthesis across otherwise disparate approaches.
