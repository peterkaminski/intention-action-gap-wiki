# Intentional Stance (Dennett)

Daniel Dennett's Intentional Stance offers a radically observer-centered approach to intention and action, treating the attribution of mental states as a pragmatic interpretive strategy rather than discovery of objective facts.

## Core Concept: Pragmatic Attribution

Rather than assuming intentions exist as discrete mental entities (as in [[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]]), Dennett argues that observers strategically attribute intentions to predict and explain behavior.

## The Three Stances

**Physical Stance**: Predicting behavior based on physical laws and mechanisms

**Design Stance**: Predicting behavior based on what something is designed to do

**Intentional Stance**: Predicting behavior by attributing beliefs, desires, and intentions as if the agent were rational

## Reframing the Four-Part Framework

Dennett's approach transforms the traditional framework:

**"Stated Intentions"**: Become communicative acts that observers interpret strategically

**"Actual Intentions"**: Lose ontological status—what matters is which attributions work for prediction

**"Observed Actions"**: Remain the primary data for interpretation

**Observer Perspective**: Becomes central—intentions exist in the eye of the beholder

## Rationality Assumption

The Intentional Stance requires assuming agents are largely rational to make predictions work. This connects to:
- [[Reasoned Action Approach]] assumptions about rational choice
- [[Planning Theory]] emphasis on coherent planning
- Tensions with [[Embodied Phenomenology]] focus on pre-rational embodied action

## Strategic Dimensions

Unlike [[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]], Dennett explicitly addresses:
- When it's useful to adopt the intentional stance vs. other approaches
- How observers choose which mental states to attribute
- Why some attributions work better than others for prediction

## Connections to Other Frameworks

**Aligns with**:
- [[Pragmatic Approaches]] emphasis on what works over what's "true"
- [[Theory of Mind]] research on attribution processes
- [[Pragmatic Approaches]] focus on practical consequences

**Challenges**:
- [[Husserlian Phenomenology]] claims about first-person authority
- [[Planning Theory]] assumption that intentions are real mental structures
- [[Ethics of Care]] emphasis on genuine understanding vs. strategic attribution

## Applications

The Intentional Stance proves particularly useful for:
- **AI and cognitive science**: Understanding when and how to model agents as intentional
- **Social prediction**: Navigating daily interactions without deep psychological knowledge
- **Legal and ethical contexts**: Pragmatic approaches to responsibility attribution
- **Cross-cultural interpretation**: Working with different conceptual frameworks for agency

## Limitations and Critiques

- May reduce rich human experience to mere predictive utility
- Potential conflict with [[Ethics of Care]] emphasis on genuine understanding
- Difficulty integrating [[Embodied Phenomenology]] insights about non-rational bodily intelligence
- Questions about whether purely strategic attribution can ground genuine moral responsibility

## Synthesis Potential

Dennett's framework offers valuable tools for synthesizing other approaches by:
- Providing pragmatic criteria for when different frameworks might be most useful
- Explaining why multiple frameworks might coexist productively
- Offering meta-level perspective on the choice between interpretive strategies
