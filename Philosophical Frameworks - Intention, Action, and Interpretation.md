# Philosophical Frameworks - Intention, Action, and Interpretation

## Comparison Table

| Framework | Key Philosophers | Core Focus | View of Intention | View of Action | Observer Perspective | Key Insights |
|-----------|------------------|------------|-------------------|----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Anscombe's Theory of Intention** | Elizabeth Anscombe | Intentional action and first-person authority | Distinguishes stated vs. actual intentions; emphasizes "Why?" question | Actions are intentional when "Why?" applies meaningfully | Asymmetry between first-person knowledge and third-person observation | Self-knowledge of intentions is privileged but not infallible |
| **Planning Theory** | Michael Bratman | Intentions as commitments over time | Intentions are plans/commitments that guide behavior, not mere desires | Actions result from executing plans and commitments | Observers interpret based on perceived planning structures | Planning bridges intention and action across time |
| **Intentional Stance** | Daniel Dennett | Behavioral interpretation strategy | Intentions are attributed by observers for predictive purposes | Actions are interpreted by assuming agent rationality | Observer perspective is primary; intentions are interpretive tools | Intentionality is a pragmatic attribution, not objective fact |
| **Theory of Mind** | Various cognitive scientists | Mental state attribution | Intentions are inferred from behavioral cues and context | Actions provide evidence for underlying mental states | Observers use specialized cognitive systems for intention detection | Brain processes actions and intentions through distinct systems |
| **Ideal Observer Theory** | Adam Smith, R.M. Hare | Moral evaluation framework | Evaluates congruence between stated and actual intentions | Actions assessed relative to intentions and outcomes | Hypothetical impartial, fully-informed observer provides moral standard | Objective moral judgment requires ideal perspective |
| **Reasoned Action Approach** | Martin Fishbein, Icek Ajzen | Behavioral prediction model | Intentions predict behavior based on attitudes, norms, and control beliefs | Behavior follows from intentions moderated by contextual factors | Observers interpret through their own belief and norm systems | Context and social factors mediate intention-action relationship |
| **Ethics of Care** | Carol Gilligan, Nel Noddings | Relational moral framework | Intentions understood within web of relationships and care | Actions evaluated by care, responsiveness, and relational impact | Emphasizes empathetic, contextual interpretation | Relationships and emotion central to moral understanding |
| **Husserlian Phenomenology** | Edmund Husserl | Structure of consciousness | Intentionality as fundamental "directedness" of consciousness | Actions emerge from intentional consciousness structures | First-person description of lived experience | Consciousness is always "consciousness of something" |
| **Heideggerian Phenomenology** | Martin Heidegger | Being-in-the-world | Comportment more fundamental than conscious intention | Practical engagement precedes theoretical reflection | Hermeneutic interpretation in historical/cultural context | Pre-cognitive practical orientation is primary |
| **Embodied Phenomenology** | Maurice Merleau-Ponty | Bodily engagement | "Motor intentionality" - body itself is intentional | Bodily activities are inherently intentional | Embodied, perceptual interpretation of others | Body "understands" through motor engagement |
| **Classical Pragmatism** | C.S. Peirce, William James | Beliefs as rules for action | Beliefs are plans for action; meaning is practical consequence | Actions test and validate beliefs/intentions | Observers evaluate based on practical consequences | "What works" determines truth and meaning |
| **Deweyan Instrumentalism** | John Dewey | Ideas as tools | Ideas are "drafts" for transforming experience | Actions execute plans to resolve problematic situations | Democratic inquiry through shared problem-solving | Truth emerges through successful problem resolution |
| **Volitionalist Theories** | Various (e.g., Brian O'Shaughnessy) | Volitions vs. intentions | Volitions are "summoning of means"; distinct from mere intentions | Actions require volitions, not just intentions | Observers distinguish between willing and intending | Volition bridges intention and bodily movement |
| **Non-Causalist Theories** | Various contemporary philosophers | Action constitution | Intentions are constituents of action, not causes | Actions incorporate intentions rather than being caused by them | Observers recognize intentions within actions | Rejects intentionâ†’action causal model |
| **Chinese Philosophy (Daoist)** | Laozi, Zhuangzi | Wu wei (non-action) | Ideal action transcends conventional goal-oriented intention | Highest action is spontaneous, effortless, beyond planning | Harmony with natural order rather than imposed interpretation | Action without forced intention achieves optimal results |
| **Buddhist Philosophy** | Various Buddhist thinkers | Action without fixed self | Intention without substantial self; karma and interdependence | Actions arise from conditions, not autonomous agents | Interdependent arising; no independent observer or actor | Challenges Western assumptions about agency and selfhood |

## Key Distinctions Across Frameworks

### **Intention-Action Relationship**
- **Causal Models**: Intentions cause actions (Davidson, Bratman)
- **Constitutive Models**: Intentions are part of actions (Non-causalists, Anscombe)
- **Pragmatic Models**: Intentions are tools for action (Dewey, James)
- **Phenomenological Models**: Intention and action are unified in lived experience (Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty)

### **Observer Role**
- **First-Person Priority**: Phenomenology, Anscombe
- **Third-Person Strategy**: Dennett, Theory of Mind
- **Ideal Observer**: Smith, Hare
- **Democratic Inquiry**: Dewey
- **Hermeneutic**: Heidegger

### **Temporal Dimension**
- **Planning Over Time**: Bratman
- **Present-Moment Engagement**: Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty
- **Consequentialist**: Pragmatists
- **Historical Context**: Hermeneutics

### **Relationship to Rationality**
- **Assumes Rationality**: Dennett, Reasoned Action
- **Questions Rationality**: Heidegger, Daoist philosophy
- **Practical Intelligence**: Dewey, Aristotelian tradition
- **Embodied Wisdom**: Merleau-Ponty

### **Moral Implications**
- **Universal Standards**: Ideal Observer, Kant
- **Contextual Ethics**: Care Ethics, Hermeneutics
- **Consequentialist**: Pragmatism
- **Virtue-Based**: Aristotelian elements in various frameworks

This table reveals how different philosophical traditions approach the fundamental questions of human agency, interpretation, and moral responsibility through markedly different conceptual lenses.
