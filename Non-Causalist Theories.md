# Non-Causalist Theories of Action

Non-causalist theories challenge the standard assumption that intentions cause actions, instead proposing that intentions are constituents or aspects of actions rather than their causal antecedents. This offers a fundamentally different approach to understanding intention-action relationships.

## Core Rejection: The Causal Model

**Standard Causal View**: Intentions are mental states that causally produce bodily movements, which then count as actions when properly caused by intentions.

**Non-Causalist Alternative**: Intentions are not separate mental causes but are internal to or constitutive of the actions themselves.

## Key Variants

### **Constitutive Theories**
Actions are partly constituted by the intentions with which they are performed. The intention is not a cause but a component of the action itself.

### **Logical Connection Theories**
The relationship between intention and action is logical or conceptual rather than causal. Intentions and actions are internally related through meaning rather than external causal connections.

### **Disjunctive Theories**
Intentional action has two distinct forms: successful execution and mere intending (when frustrated by circumstances). These are not causally related but represent different ways of being intentional.

## Influence from Key Philosophers

### **Elizabeth Anscombe**
Though sometimes read as a causalist, [[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]] contains non-causalist elements:
- Intentions are known "without observation" rather than inferred from causal relationships
- The "Why?" question reveals logical rather than causal connections
- Practical knowledge involves knowing what one is doing without observing causal chains

### **Contemporary Developers**
Modern philosophers have developed these insights into systematic alternatives to causal theories, often drawing on [[Embodied Phenomenology]] and [[Hermeneutic Phenomenology]].

## Four-Part Framework Analysis

**Stated Intentions**: Understood as:
- **Linguistic expressions** of the intentional aspects constituting ongoing or planned actions
- **Conceptual articulations** of what one is already doing or committed to doing
- **Public dimensions** of actions rather than separate mental causes

**Actual Intentions**: Reconceived as:
- **Constitutive aspects** of actions themselves rather than prior mental states
- **Internal descriptions** of what one is doing rather than causal explanations of why it happens
- **Lived meaning** of action from the agent's perspective

**Observed Actions**: Interpreted as:
- **Intentional phenomena** that include intention as an internal aspect
- **Meaningful behaviors** whose intentional character is observable, not just inferred
- **Holistic activities** that cannot be decomposed into separate mental and physical components

**Observer Perspective**: Involves:
- **Direct perception** of intentional action rather than inference from behavior to mental causes
- **Interpretive understanding** of meaning rather than causal explanation
- **Holistic recognition** of intentional activities rather than reconstruction from parts

## Relationship to Other Frameworks

**Builds on**:
- [[Anscombe's Theory of Intention]]: Developing non-observational knowledge insights
- [[Embodied Phenomenology]]: Motor intentionality as non-causal directedness
- [[Hermeneutic Phenomenology]]: Meaning-based rather than causal understanding

**Challenges**:
- [[Planning Theory]]: Questions whether plans cause actions or are aspects of extended actions
- [[Reasoned Action Approach]]: Rejects causal relationship between attitudes/norms and behavior
- [[Theory of Mind]]: Questions whether we infer mental causes or perceive intentional actions directly

**Complements**:
- [[Intentional Stance]]: Both question the ontological status of mental states, though for different reasons
- [[Chinese Philosophy]]: Resonates with wu wei emphasis on non-causal, natural action
- [[Ethics of Care]]: Supports relational understanding vs. individual causal agency

## Key Arguments

### **Against Causal Deviance**
Causal theories struggle with cases where intentions cause actions in the "wrong way" (e.g., nervousness about a presentation causing one to give a bad presentation). Non-causalists argue this shows intention-action relationships are logical rather than causal.

### **Temporal Unity**
In ongoing action, intention and execution are temporally unified rather than sequential. The intention to walk doesn't cause walking; walking intentionally involves ongoing intentional direction.

### **First-Person Authority**
Agents typically know what they're doing without observing causal chains. This suggests intentions are known as constitutive aspects of action rather than as separate mental causes.

### **Perception of Action**
We often directly perceive others' intentional actions (reaching for a cup) rather than inferring intentions from observed movements. This suggests intentionality is a visible aspect of action.

## Applications

Non-causalist theories prove valuable for:
- **Legal responsibility**: Understanding how intentional character is internal to criminal acts
- **Moral evaluation**: Focusing on what people do intentionally rather than mental causation
- **Skill analysis**: Understanding how expertise involves intentional engagement rather than mental control
- **Therapeutic contexts**: Working with what clients are doing rather than what causes their behavior
- **AI and robotics**: Designing systems with embodied intentionality rather than separate planning modules

## Limitations and Critiques

**Explanatory Power**: Critics argue non-causalist theories provide insufficient explanation of why actions occur

**Predictive Utility**: Causal theories seem better at predicting behavior from prior mental states

**Scientific Integration**: Difficulty integrating with neuroscientific research on brain causation of behavior

**Practical Intervention**: Causal theories seem more useful for changing behavior through changing attitudes or intentions

## Synthesis Contributions

Non-causalist theories enhance synthesis by:
- **Conceptual Clarification**: Distinguishing causal explanation from meaning interpretation
- **Phenomenological Grounding**: Connecting to [[Embodied Phenomenology]] insights about action
- **Alternative Logic**: Providing logical rather than empirical criteria for intention-action relationships
- **Holistic Perspective**: Avoiding reductionist decomposition of action into mental and physical parts

## Integration with Other Frameworks

**With [[Embodied Phenomenology]]**: Strong resonance around motor intentionality and skilled coping as non-causal directedness

**With [[Chinese Philosophy]]**: Alignment with wu wei conception of natural, non-forced action

**With [[Ethics of Care]]**: Support for relational understanding vs. individual causal responsibility

**With [[Hermeneutic Phenomenology]]**: Shared emphasis on meaning-based rather than causal understanding

**Tension with [[Theory of Mind]]**: Challenges assumption that mental state attribution involves causal inference, but may complement direct perception approaches

## Contemporary Developments

Modern non-causalist research engages with:
- **Direct perception theories**: Visual perception of intentional action without mental state inference
- **Embodied cognition**: 4E approaches that challenge internal/external mental causation
- **Phenomenological psychiatry**: Understanding mental illness through disrupted intentional action
- **Philosophy of sport**: Analysis of skilled performance as non-causal intentional engagement

## Research Directions

Emerging areas include:
- **Neurophilosophy**: Integration with brain research on action and intention
- **Cross-cultural action theory**: How different cultures understand intention-action relationships
- **Applied ethics**: Non-causalist approaches to responsibility and moral evaluation
- **Cognitive science**: Alternative models of action control and planning
- **Legal philosophy**: Implications for criminal responsibility and intentional action

## Future Synthesis Potential

Non-causalist theories offer unique synthesis opportunities by:
- Providing conceptual tools for integrating phenomenological and empirical approaches
- Offering alternative to reductive physicalism while maintaining naturalistic credibility
- Supporting holistic approaches that resist mind-body dualism
- Connecting Western action theory to non-Western wisdom traditions
- Grounding practical ethics in lived experience rather than abstract principles
